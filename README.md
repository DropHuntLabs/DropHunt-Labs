# DropHunt Labs – Multichain Crypto Airdrop Tracker

## 🧠 Overview
**DropHunt Labs** is developing a multichain airdrop tracker that helps users safely discover, verify, and participate in legitimate crypto airdrops across multiple blockchain ecosystems.

Our mission is to increase transparency and user protection in Web3 by aggregating verified airdrop information from trusted sources and allowing users to check eligibility directly through wallet lookup.
